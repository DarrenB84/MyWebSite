### My Interest in IT
My interest in IT began from when I was a child. I didn't have access to computers or video game consoles at home but anywhere I went where there was a PC or electronics I was drawn to them. I particulary remember looking forward to heading over to my cousins house and sitting on my uncles 486 computer running Windows 3.11 all day. As I grew older and was able to leave the house on my own I was drawn to anywhere that had the internet and I would enjoy sitting in libraries online, internet cafes or just sitting at a friends house around one PC interacting online. 

### My IT Experience
I began working in the ICT support field as my first fulltime job in 2005. I have been working in the indrustry since and have gained valuable knopwledge and expeince along the way. I hope to further my career opportunities in the sector by completing my bachelor's degree.
