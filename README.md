### My Interest in IT
My interest in IT began from when I was a child. I didn't have access to computers or video game consoles at home but anywhere I went where there was a PC or electronics I was drawn to them. I particularly remember looking forward to heading over to my cousin’s house and sitting on my uncles 486 computer running Windows 3.11 all day. As I grew older and was able to leave the house on my own I was drawn to anywhere that had the internet and I would enjoy sitting in libraries online, internet cafes or just sitting at a friend’s house around one PC taking turns driving towards an agreed goal. 

### My IT Experience
I began working in the ICT support field as my first fulltime job in 2005. I have been working in the industry since and have gained valuable knowledge and experience along the way. I hope to further my career opportunities in the sector by completing my bachelor's degree.

### Why I chose RMIT
I enquired through Open Universities Australia about commencing university study online and this is where I was advised RMIT offer exactly what I was after. RMIT have a solid reputation for graduates finding work post studies. At the moment I am balancing work as well as studies so the online aspect is great for me to find a healthy balance.

### What I expect to learn
I expect to become far more technical with my knowledge of IT. I expect to be able to understand computer code and be able to write and create basic programs that I can have fun with and save myself time with my day to day key responsibilities. I expect to learn more around servers and networking. I also expect to learn and develop stronger business related skills relating to the ICT field.

### A little more about me
Outside of technology my other interests are gardening - growing my own food, my pets and animals - my dog and cat, I enjoy craft beers and various whiskeys, I try to exercise and keep healthy - cycling & gym, I only speak English but am first generation of an Italian background, I'm a foodie and I like rainy evenings on the couch binge watching Netflix

### Ideal Job
https://smartjobs.qld.gov.au/jobs/QLD-CO304353-19P
<br />The position linked above **(Senior Technical Developer)** is the kind of role I would aspire to be doing within the next ten years. It is an extensive technical role that requires many years of experience in coding and development testing. The position is also for a senior person who would be a team lead and mentor to other code developers. The requirement to code and develop is not only required but many years' experience and the ability to manage and lead a team in a very technical area. The skills required would most likely a degree in IT as well as training and qualifications in business management. As of right now I am very junior in my skills and experience, I have no knowledge or skills in writing code and have no prior tertiary education in IT - that's a big reason why I'm here! I hope to successfully complete my degree in IT and obtain the skills and experience to become and developer and tester and then from there gain experience on the job site to one day be qualified and experienced to take on such a position.

**What the results mean for me;**
<br />I see that these results indicate that I am a quiet person in group situations who learns best with a hands on approach over book studies. I can relate to this and feel that I like IT because I can see the results of my work develop in front of me. The results may also indicate that I might be too hard on myself and view myself in a negative light. I think with more education and success my mind set and confidence in myself can grow in a more positive direction.
