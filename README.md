## Welcome to Darren Bonelli's GitHub Page

About me: I've been working in the ICT support field for around 14 years and have decided to better my career opportunities by completing my bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I hope that in a few years from now I will be away from answering support calls and instead performing much more challenging and technical tasks that I will find rewarding. I chose to do my university studies with RMIT as they have an excellent reputation with graduates finding work post studies and they were flexible in offering online study through Open Universities Australia. I have always had an interest in computers and technology and it was always inevitable that I was going to find a career in the field. My other interests include animals - my cat and dog, gardening, motorcycles, cars and enjoying the odd craft beer.
