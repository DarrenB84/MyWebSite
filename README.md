### My Interest in IT
My interest in IT began from when I was a child. I didn't have access to computers or video game consoles at home but anywhere I went where there was a PC or electronics I was drawn to them. I particularly remember looking forward to heading over to my cousin’s house and sitting on my uncles 486 computer running Windows 3.11 all day. As I grew older and was able to leave the house on my own I was drawn to anywhere that had the internet and I would enjoy sitting in libraries online, internet cafes or just sitting at a friend’s house around one PC taking turns driving towards an agreed goal. 

### My IT Experience
I began working in the ICT support field as my first fulltime job in 2005. I have been working in the industry since and have gained valuable knowledge and experience along the way. I hope to further my career opportunities in the sector by completing my bachelor's degree.

### Why I chose RMIT
I enquired through Open Universities Australia about commencing university study online and this is where I was advised RMIT offer exactly what I was after. RMIT have a solid reputation for graduates finding work post studies. At the moment I am balancing work as well as studies so the online aspect is great for me to find a healthy balance.

### What I expect to learn
I expect to become far more technical with my knowledge of IT. I expect to be able to understand computer code and be able to write and create basic programs that I can have fun with and save myself time with my day to day key responsibilities. I expect to learn more around servers and networking. I also expect to learn and develop stronger business related skills relating to the ICT field.

### A little more about me
Outside of technology my other interests are gardening - growing my own food, my pets and animals - my dog and cat, I enjoy craft beers and various whiskeys, I try to exercise and keep healthy - cycling & gym, I only speak English but am first generation of an Italian background, I'm a foodie and I like rainy evenings on the couch binge watching Netflix

### Ideal Job
An ideal job for my future self would be the Senior Technical Developer role with Education Queensland - https://smartjobs.qld.gov.au/jobs/QLD-CO304353-19P
